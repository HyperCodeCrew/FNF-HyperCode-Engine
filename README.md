## HyPsych Enging Is next-gen of Psych Engine!

you can use it to make your mod more powerful!

---
### What is HyPsych Engine?
It's a fork of [Psych Engine 1.0.4](https://github.com/shadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), but with a lot of new features and improvements.

### Features:
- **HScript on Lua [Beta]**  
  Classic HScript syntax now runs *alongside Lua*! (*One tiny bug—[we're on it](https://github.com/Paopun20/FNF-HyPsych-Engine/issues)*)
- **Optimized Garbage Collector**
  Smoother gameplay, fewer hitches. *Your mods won’t stutter even if your beats do.*  
- **C++11 Unleashed**  
  Modern codebase for maximum performance and compatibility.  

### Lua extensions *(Modder’s Paradise)* :
| Extension | Status | Description |  
|-----------|--------|-------------|  
| **`BrainF*ck`** | Stable | *Yes, really.* Interpret Brainf*ck code mid-song. Meme responsibly. |
| **`GetArgs`** | Stable | Fetch command-line args like a pro. Perfect for custom mod tools. |
| **`HttpClient`** | Stable | Make HTTP(S) requests. Build mods that talk to APIs, Discord, etc. **BUT YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD OR UPLOAD FILES FROM IT FOR SECURITY REASONS.** |
| **`JsonHelper`** | Stable | JSON parsing so easy, even your grandma could mod. |
| **`ScreenInfo`** | Stable | Dynamically adapt mods to any screen size/resolution. |
| **`UrlGen`** | Stable | Build URLs on the fly. Pair with `HttpClient` for endless chaos. |
| **`WindowManager`** | Beta | *"Move that window!"* Control position, size, fullscreen—mostly works™. |
