# HyperCode Enging Is next-gen of Psych Engine!
This engine is a fork of Psych Engine 1.0.4, featuring new capabilities, performance upgrades, scripting improvements, and experimental 3D support, more.

## Document
### [HyperCode Enging Lua API](docs/HyperCodeEnging/LuaAPI.md)
### [Psych Engine API](https://shadowmario.github.io/psychengine.lua/)

## About
HyperCode Engine is a fork of the Psych Engine

> ⚠️ Not much of the original codebase remains… Rewrite until nothing remains of the original. LOL /j

# Features:
- **Custom Menu [It should be stable now, right?]**
  Create a menu using HScript! This allows for more complex and customizable menus.

- **Optimized Garbage Collection**
  Experience smoother gameplay with fewer performance hitches. Your mods won’t stutter, even during complex beats!

- **C++11 Codebase**
  A modern, efficient codebase to maximize performance and ensure compatibility with the latest systems.

- **Buffer [Work in Progress]**
  Buffers temporarily store data in memory for more efficient data handling, improving overall performance.

- **3D model support [ !! Work in Progress !! | NOT WORKING, IT TOO MUCH ERROR ]**
  Now you can use 3D models in your mods! This feature allows for more complex and visually appealing scenes.

# **Easy Modding** (with Chaos Included)
Just like Psych Engine, HyperCode Engine is made for modders — with a cool API and powerful features.  
…But also probably a little confusing. Sorry not sorry.
